PromptxAI prepares knowledge workers for future of work, using AI to scale human capability.

PromptxAI mission is to explore a disproportionate emerging problem - the loss of leverage for knowledge workers. Leverage drives work, which creates value and ultimately wealth. PromptxAI addresses a complex interplay of three factors: the increasing ability of AI to do our work better than we can, the continued use of outdated tools for knowledge work, and the inadequacy of formal education in preparing us for the future of work.
