## LangChain

Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.

LLMs: This includes a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.

Document Loaders: This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources.

Utils: Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application.

Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.

Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.

Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.

Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.
