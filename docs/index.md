# Generative AI Playbook by PromptxAI

Generative AI is disrupting many industries and significantly reshaping future of work for many creative and knowledge-driven functions. PromptxAI is on a mission to help businesses and individuals leverage the power of Generative AI to accelerate their growth and innovation. We are building a Generative AI Playbook to help you get started with Generative AI. You can access the Generative AI Playbook on this website in various ways including learning creative prompt engineering [techniques](chatgpt/generating-diagrams-from-world-knowledge) to make the most of Generative AI applications like [ChatGPT](chatgpt/historical-fact-question-answer), Midjourney, DALL-E, [Stable Diffusion](stability-ai/interview-with-stability-ai-ceo), D-ID, and more. You can also learn about the [trends](chatgpt/openai-ceo-sam-altman-on-ai-for-the-next-era) impacting future of work and how to leverage these as ideas for your own business or career. We are also sharing accelerator [notebooks](api/low-code-blog-authoring-automation) and code [libraries](api/promptxai-api) to help you get started with Generative AI.

Here is a version of the playbook with most popular examples.

Here is a generic version of the playbook which extends the Generative AI landscape with Agents, Tools, and Content. This playbook extends and uses [LangChain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as a generic framework for working with LLMs.

1. **Prompts:** This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.
2. **Models:** This includes LLMs and pre-trained deep learning transformer models.
3. **Content:** This includes content which can be used to enhance a prompt with few-shot learning, content which can fine-tune an LLM, or content which can be enhanced or generated by LLM completions.
4. **Tools:** Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more.
5. **Chains:** Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility).
6. **Agents:** Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done.
7. **Memory:** Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent.
8. **Infrastructure:** This includes hubs like Hugging Face, GitHub, and Kaggle. It also includes cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure. First movers like OpenAI and Stability AI are hosted providers of LLMs. Another emerging category is specialized multi-cloud orchestrators for LLM training, optimization, and inference.

## Trends impacting future of work

There are several trends impacting future of work. We are concerned about impact on the knowledge worker and startup community. Here are some trends we believe are at the heart of the workplace disruption as explained by ChatGPT Transformer model (leading example of trend 1) generated completions or responses based on prompts or inputs we have provided (example of trend 2). We have coined a shared name for GitHub, Kaggle, and Huggingface as trend 3, calling them Creator Hubs.

## Trend 1: Generative AI

ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, D-ID are popular applications of Generative AI. While ChatGPT generates human-like responses as a chatbot, DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion can generate images from text prompts. D-ID generates videos. Behind the scenes these applications use Transformer models such as GPT-3, also known as Large Language Models.

!!! note "ChatGPT Completion"
    Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new data from existing data. It is used to generate new data that is similar to existing data, but not identical. Generative AI can be used to create new images, music, text, and videos.

    One of the most well-known examples of generative AI is Google’s DeepDream. DeepDream is a computer vision program that uses a deep neural network to generate new images based on existing images. It can be used to create surreal and abstract images from existing photographs.

    Another example of generative AI is OpenAI’s GPT-3. GPT-3 is a natural language processing system that can generate text based on existing text. It can be used to generate new stories, articles, and other written content.

    Finally, generative AI can also be used to create new music. Google’s Magenta project uses generative AI to create new music based on existing music. It can be used to create new compositions or remix existing songs.

## Trend 2: Prompt Engineering

Prompt Engineering is right now the buzz on social media. It is interesting how Sam Altman addresses future of Prompt Engineering in the interview (25:09) where he thinks it will evolve to people just interacting with AGI in a natural way. However, Reid Hoffman makes a counterpoint how an artist can articulate much better prompts and get more out of Transformer Models than a casual user.

Explain Prompt Engineering as it applies to models like ChatGPT and Midjourney
```

!!! note "ChatGPT Completion"
    Prompt engineering is a technique used to improve the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models such as ChatGPT and Midjourney. It involves carefully crafting the input to the model to ensure that it produces the desired output. This can involve changing the wording of the input, adding additional context, or providing additional information. By doing this, the model can better understand the user’s intent and provide more accurate and relevant responses. Prompt engineering can also be used to improve the model’s ability to generate natural-sounding responses.


## Trends 3: Creator Hubs

To understand the gap between successful entrepreneurs or startup teams and the typical knowledge worker at an established enterprise, one can compare their tooling, work habits, and skills. Alternatively, one can look at the rapid clip of advances made by open source and citizen data science communities versus those of market leaders in the same space. The acquisitions of Kaggle by Google in 2017 (financial terms undisclosed), GitHub by Microsoft in 2018 (for $7.5 billion), Streamlit by Snowflake in 2021 (for $800 million), the $2 billion valuation of Huggingface, and the projected $20 billion valuation of OpenAI at the end of 2022 demonstrate the impact of these new market makers on the future of work and the growth of a community of knowledge workers learning new skills. Hugging Face offers Streamlit Spaces for hosting apps built on Streamlit. OpenAI GPT-2 model is available on Hugging Face Models reponsitory (as on Feb'23 hosting more than 133K pre-trained models).
