# Large Language Models

We are creating a reference of popular and recently released large language models. This is a work in progress and we welcome contributions. Our objective is to demonstrate PromptxAI API capabilities in generating human-readable content which is also structured and factually accurate for programmatic access via an API.

## Why Large Language Models Matter

Large language models are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that use deep learning techniques to process natural language. They are being used in a wide range of applications, from chatbots to summarizing text. The concept of large language models was first introduced by Google in 2018 with its BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. BERT was trained on a large corpus of text to learn the relationships between words and phrases. This enabled it to better understand the context of the text and produce more accurate results.

Since then, the use of large language models has grown exponentially. According to one industry influencer, Andrew Ng, “Large language models are revolutionizing natural language processing. They are more accurate, faster, and easier to use than traditional language models.” Large language models are also being used to generate text. OpenAI’s GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a large language model that can generate human-like text from a few words of input. It is being used to generate articles, stories, and even code.

The potential of large language models is immense. As Andrew Ng said, “The ability to generate human-like text is a game-changer for natural language processing. It opens up a whole new world of possibilities for AI applications.” Large language models are also being used to improve the accuracy of machine translation. Google’s Translatotron is a large language model that can translate from one language to another without relying on a separate machine translation system. This has the potential to significantly reduce the time and cost associated with traditional machine translation systems. The possibilities of large language models are exciting, and the technology is only going to get better. As another industry influencer, Fei-Fei Li, said, “Large language models are going to be the foundation of the next wave of AI applications.”
