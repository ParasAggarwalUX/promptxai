# Generative AI Supported Product Innovation Process

Question: How might we help Product Designer adopt Generative AI to benefit their learning and get more efficient at their work?

Product Designer plays an important role in making a user fall in love with a product that they use. A designer’s day-to-day work involves applying their specialised knowledge and skills in user experience design to create products and services that meet the needs of users. They  spend their time researching, designing, prototyping, and testing products to ensure that they are user-friendly, accessible, and effective.
