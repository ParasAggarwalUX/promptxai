      "The last few years have seen the emergence of a new group of website tools – static website generators – that are quickly gaining popularity. While dynamic web pages have long been the way websites are created and hosted, static website generators are becoming increasingly popular as they offer an easier, more secure, and cost-effective alternative to dynamic web pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Static website generators work by taking content written in a variety of different markup languages – like HTML, Markdown, and XML – and automatically converting it into HTML pages. This means that the same content can be used for multiple platforms, such as a website, a blog, or an e-commerce store without the need for additional coding. This also allows the content to be quickly updated without worrying about the underlying codebase, making it much easier for non-technical users to create and manage their own websites.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the convenience and cost savings of using a static website generator, there are also security benefits. Since the code is already pre-compiled, there's no need to worry about malicious code being injected into the website – making it an ideal solution for sensitive data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the flexibility of static website generators makes them particularly attractive, as they can be used to create anything from simple personal sites to complex applications. This allows users to create the exact type of website they need, while still having the assurance that their content can easily be updated and managed.\n",

      "\n",
      "At its core, Jekyll is a templating engine that takes content from various sources and compiles it into a static website. This means that content is stored in files, and then referenced in templates which then produce the final product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jekyll is highly customizable, with a myriad of features enabling developers to create a wide range of static websites. It supports a wide variety of markup languages and templating engines, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, it provides support for Sass and Less, two popular CSS pre-processors. It also supports YAML, a versatile language to structure and query data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Jekyll makes it easy to add dynamic content to static sites. Through its Liquid templating language, users can directly embed content from other sources in their websites. This comes in handy when you want to embed a third-party widget, show user comments, or integrate a CMS. Moreover, you can use plugins to further extend the features and capabilities of your websites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, since pages are compiled and served as static HTML, Jekyll-generated sites benefit from improved performance and security. They are served faster, since there is no need for a database or paging. Moreover, due to the lack of a back-end, malicious attacks are mitigated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, Jekyll is a powerful static website generator with a wide variety of features to build high-quality and dynamic websites. From a multitude of markup languages and templating engines to YAML and Liquid integration, Jekyll provides the necessary tools to create stunning websites.\n"
